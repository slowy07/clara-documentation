This project is focused on improving the documentation for the Clara project. Clara are open sourec library for quantum computing processing that is designed to be faster on classical computer. the library provides a high-level interface for writing quantum algorithm and it uses a variety of techniques to optimize the performance of these algorithm on classical computer. the lib has the potential to make quantum algorithm more accessible to a wider range of researcher and developers and could help to accelerate the develompent of quantum computing applications
